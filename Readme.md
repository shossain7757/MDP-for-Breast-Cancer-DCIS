# Overview

The repository encompasses a simulated environment for modeling the dynamic progression of breast cancer patients at the DCIS stage. The simulation employs a Markov decision process, as detailed in the paper titled *Robust AI-enabled Simulation of Treatment Paths with Markov Decision Process for Breast Cancer Patients*. The simulator is designed to emulate treatment pathways for breast cancer DCIS patients based on the recommended treatments outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
